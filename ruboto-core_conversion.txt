Documenting steps to convert ruboto-irb over to ruboto-core

gem install ruboto-core

(From project project parent directory)
	ruboto gen app --name "Ruboto IRB" --activity IRB --package org.ruboto.irb --path ./Ruboto_IRB --target android-8

Mods to default app gen
	- Remove res/layout/main.xml
	- Remove default icons for different resolutions
	- Modified res/values/strings.xml app name IRB to Ruboto IRB

Copy from original project
	- ruboto-key.keystore
	- keystore values into build.properties (key.store, key.alias, key.store.password, key.alias.password)
    - RubotoDialog.java and change package to org.ruboto (now added back into ruboto-core)
    - res/drawable directory (change name app_icon to icon)
    - assets/demo-scripts directory (removed demo-ruboto-irb and ruboto)
    - res/layout/empty_relative_layout.xml
	- local.properies.EXAMPLE
	- .gitignore
	- README.markdown
    - libraries (jruby-jar ones are not ready for use yet)

Generate custom activites, add to manifest, write script
	ruboto gen class Activity --name ShortcutBuilder
	ruboto gen class Activity --name ScriptLauncher (for shortcuts)

Bring over components of the old manifest
    - Permissions
    - Screen resolution
    - Prefers sdcard
    - Version #
    - Version name
    - Activity definition of RobotoActivity & Dialog
    - Intent definition for browsing *.rb
    - Activity definition for ShortcutBuilder and ScriptLauncher

Additional classes:
	- Created RubotoEditText to use for LineNumbeEditText

Modified irb.rb
	- Begin with demo-ruboto-irb.rb
	- Setup $SCRIPT_DIR variable instead of assuming cwd
	- Fixed bug reloading scripts from assets
	- Copy scripts if they don't exist
	- Add in 3.0 functionality

Changes already made in github:
	- Remove "abstract" on RubotoActivity
    - Added RubotoDialog.java and change package to org.ruboto
	- Modified ruboto.rb to handle both RubotoActivity and RubotoDialog
	- Switch to launching activities using class instead of class name

Changes made to this source (suggested for ruboto-core):
	- Added printStackTrace to RubotoActivity when script fails 
	- roboto.rb - Added the ability to import widgets from other packages than android.widget
	- Added array to hold menu_items to fix bug where menus didn't work
	- callback gen needs to set run's ruby_method to on_run (all callbacks that don't start with "on")
	- change all attempts to print to ruby's error stream to just print (forcing it to logcat)

Needed:
    - Rake to setup libraries
	- Better way to force scripts to reload
    
Mods to demo scripts
	- Modified demo date dialog to use java dates
	- Modified script_market to not use Script.getDir

To do:
	- Remove menu and code to reload irb.rb
	- Work with old SDKs
	- Stack problem
	- Split tab contents into separate scripts
	- Make a way to encapsulate a view into its own object
